<h2>About Saola</h2>  
Saola <i>(Pseudoryx nghetinhensis)</i> is one of the world's rarest large mammals, found only in the Annamite Range of Vietnam and Laos. The saola is currently considered to be critically endangered. Its restrictive habitat requirements and aversion to human proximity are likely to endanger it through habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Saola suffer losses through local hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and for use of the meat in restaurants and food markets. As far as there are only few hundred specimens of this animal, hunting for their furs is lucrative local business, which leads to a gradual decline in the already small population. This animal was chosen as mascot for this project to raise awareness, that even animals, that were discovered very recently and live very remotely from humans are also endangered and people have got big impact on it.
